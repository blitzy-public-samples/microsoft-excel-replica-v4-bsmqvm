# Microsoft Excel Project

## Project Overview

Microsoft Excel is a comprehensive spreadsheet application designed to meet the data management, analysis, and visualization needs of a wide range of users, from individuals to large enterprises. This project aims to deliver a powerful, cross-platform spreadsheet solution that maintains Microsoft Excel's position as the world's leading spreadsheet application.

## Key Features

- Robust data management and organization
- Advanced calculation and analysis tools
- Powerful data visualization capabilities
- Real-time collaboration features
- Cross-platform accessibility (Desktop, Web, and Mobile)
- Extensibility through add-ins and integrations
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance

## System Architecture

The Microsoft Excel project is built on a modular architecture, consisting of the following main components:

1. Core Engine
2. Calculation Engine
3. Data Analysis Engine
4. Charting Engine
5. Frontend Applications (Web, Desktop, and Mobile)
6. Backend API
7. Add-in Framework
8. Collaboration Services

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+) for web and backend development
- .NET Framework for desktop application development
- Xcode for iOS development
- Android Studio for Android development
- CMake for building C++ components

### Setting up the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/excel-project.git
   cd excel-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies for each component:
   ```
   # Web frontend
   cd src/frontend-web
   npm install

   # Backend API
   cd src/backend-api
   npm install

   # Desktop frontend
   cd src/frontend-desktop
   dotnet restore

   # Mobile frontend
   cd src/frontend-mobile/ios
   pod install
   cd ../android
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. Set up the core C++ components:
   ```
   cd src/core-engine
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:
   Copy the `.env.example` files in relevant directories and rename them to `.env`. Update the values as needed.

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
2. Make your changes and commit them with clear, concise commit messages
3. Push your branch and create a pull request
4. Ensure all tests pass and the code meets the project's coding standards
5. Request a code review from team members
6. Once approved, merge your changes into the main branch

## Building and Deployment

Refer to the `infrastructure/` directory for deployment scripts and configuration files. The project uses a CI/CD pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/` for automated building, testing, and deployment.

## Testing

Run tests for each component:

```
# Web frontend
cd src/frontend-web
npm test

# Backend API
cd src/backend-api
npm test

# Core engine
cd src/core-engine/build
ctest

# Desktop frontend
cd src/frontend-desktop
dotnet test

# Mobile frontend
cd src/frontend-mobile/ios
xcodebuild test
cd ../android
./gradlew test
```
