# Excel Add-in Framework

## Introduction

The Excel Add-in Framework is a powerful and flexible system designed to extend Excel's functionality through add-ins. This framework provides developers with the tools and interfaces necessary to create, integrate, and manage add-ins seamlessly within the Microsoft Excel ecosystem.

## Architecture Overview

The Add-in Framework is built on a modular architecture that consists of several key components:

1. **Interfaces**
   - `IAddIn`: Defines the interface for add-ins
   - `IAddInHost`: Defines the interface for the add-in host
   - `IExcelInterop`: Defines the interface for Excel interoperability

2. **Core Components**
   - `AddInManager`: Manages the lifecycle and interactions of add-ins

3. **Utility Classes**
   - `AddInLogger`: Handles logging for add-ins
   - `ErrorHandler`: Manages error handling and reporting

4. **Security**
   - `PermissionManager`: Manages permissions for add-ins
   - `AddInSandbox`: Provides a secure execution environment for add-ins

5. **Discovery and Marketplace**
   - `AddInDiscovery`: Handles the discovery of available add-ins
   - `MarketplaceIntegration`: Integrates with the add-in marketplace

6. **API Access**
   - `ExcelDataAccess`: Provides access to Excel data
   - `ExcelUIAccess`: Allows interaction with Excel's user interface
   - `ExcelEventHandler`: Manages Excel events

7. **Add-in Types**
   - `COMAddInWrapper`: Wrapper for COM add-ins
   - `XLLAddInWrapper`: Wrapper for XLL add-ins
   - `OfficeAddInHost`: Host for Office JavaScript add-ins

## Getting Started

To start developing add-ins using this framework:

1. Include the necessary headers:
   ```cpp
   #include "interfaces/IAddIn.h"
   #include "interfaces/IAddInHost.h"
   #include "interfaces/IExcelInterop.h"
   ```

2. Implement the `IAddIn` interface for your add-in:
   ```cpp
   class MyAddIn : public IAddIn {
     // Implement interface methods
   };
   ```

3. Use the `AddInManager` to register and manage your add-in:
   ```cpp
   AddInManager::getInstance().registerAddIn(std::make_shared<MyAddIn>());
   ```

## API Documentation

For detailed API documentation, please refer to the following header files:
- `src/add-in-framework/interfaces/IAddIn.h`
- `src/add-in-framework/interfaces/IAddInHost.h`
- `src/add-in-framework/interfaces/IExcelInterop.h`
- `src/add-in-framework/AddInManager.h`

## Best Practices

1. Always implement proper error handling using the `ErrorHandler` class.
2. Use the `AddInLogger` for consistent logging across your add-in.
3. Respect the permissions set by the `PermissionManager` to ensure security.
4. Utilize the `AddInSandbox` when executing potentially unsafe code.
5. Implement the `IAddIn` interface fully to ensure compatibility with the framework.

## Security Considerations

- All add-ins are subject to security checks and permissions managed by the `PermissionManager`.
- The `AddInSandbox` provides an isolated environment for add-in execution to prevent unauthorized access to system resources.
- Always validate and sanitize input data received from add-ins before processing.

## Testing and Debugging

The framework includes a comprehensive test suite:
- Unit tests: `src/add-in-framework/tests/`
- Integration tests: Ensure your add-in works correctly with the Excel application.

Use the `AddInLogger` to add debug information during development.

## Deployment

1. Compile your add-in as a dynamic library (DLL for Windows, dylib for macOS).
2. Use the appropriate wrapper (`COMAddInWrapper` or `XLLAddInWrapper`) based on your add-in type.
3. For Office JavaScript add-ins, use the `OfficeAddInHost` and follow the Office Add-ins deployment guidelines.

## Version Compatibility

The Add-in Framework is designed to be compatible with Excel versions 2016 and later. Always check the `VersionManager` to ensure compatibility with specific Excel versions.
