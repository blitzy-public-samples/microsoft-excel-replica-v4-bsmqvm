// src/shared/hooks/index.ts

// This file serves as the main entry point for exporting custom React hooks
// used across the Microsoft Excel application. It aggregates and re-exports
// hooks from individual files to provide a centralized import location for consumers.

// Import hooks from individual files
import { useDebounce } from './useDebounce';
import { useLocalStorage } from './useLocalStorage';
import { useAuth } from './useAuth';

// Re-export hooks
export {
  useDebounce,
  useLocalStorage,
  useAuth,
};

// Optionally, you can also export the hooks as a default object
export default {
  useDebounce,
  useLocalStorage,
  useAuth,
};

// This file addresses the following requirements:
// 1. Code Organization: Centralizes custom hooks for easy import and maintenance
// 2. Reusability: Promotes code reuse across the application by providing a single import point

// Note: Make sure to update this file when adding new custom hooks to the project.
```

This implementation creates an index file that imports and re-exports the custom hooks used in the Microsoft Excel application. It provides a centralized location for importing these hooks, which promotes code organization and reusability across the application.

The file includes comments explaining its purpose and the requirements it addresses. It also includes a note to remind developers to update this file when adding new custom hooks to the project.

By using this index file, other parts of the application can import multiple hooks from a single location, like this:

```typescript
import { useDebounce, useLocalStorage, useAuth } from 'src/shared/hooks';
