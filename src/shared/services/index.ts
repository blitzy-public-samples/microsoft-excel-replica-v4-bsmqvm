/**
 * @fileoverview
 * This module centralizes the export of all shared services used in the Microsoft Excel application.
 * It addresses the following requirements:
 * 1. Modularity: Provides a centralized export point for all shared services
 * 2. Code Organization: Simplifies imports and maintains a clean project structure
 * 
 * The exported services include:
 * - EventEmitter: Provides event handling capabilities
 * - LocalStorageService: Manages local storage operations
 * - HttpService: Handles HTTP communications
 * 
 * By centralizing these exports, we ensure that other parts of the application can easily
 * import and use these services without needing to know their exact file locations.
 * This approach promotes better code organization and makes it easier to manage
 * dependencies throughout the project.
