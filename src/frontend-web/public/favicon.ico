1. File format: ICO (Windows Icon)
2. Typical sizes to include: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48 pixels
3. Color depth: 32-bit (RGBA) and 8-bit versions
4. Design: Should be consistent with Microsoft Excel's overall visual identity
5. Purpose: Provides a visual identifier for the Excel web app in browser tabs, bookmarks, and other UI elements where a small icon is needed

The favicon should address the "Application Branding" requirement as specified in the Technical specification/1.1 System Objectives/Cross-platform Accessibility section.

Note: This file is static and does not contain any executable code. It will be served directly by the web server and used by web browsers to display the site's icon.

To create this file, you would typically use a graphic design tool that supports ICO file creation, such as Adobe Photoshop with the ICO plugin, or specialized favicon generators. The icon should be a simplified version of the Microsoft Excel logo or a related symbol that is easily recognizable at small sizes.

Remember to test the favicon at different sizes to ensure it remains clear and identifiable, especially at the smallest (16x16) size.
