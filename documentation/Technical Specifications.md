    WORKBOOK ||--|{ WORKSHEET : contains
    WORKBOOK ||--o{ VERSION : has
    WORKBOOK ||--o{ SHARING : has
    USER ||--o{ SHARING : participates
    WORKBOOK ||--o{ COMMENT : has
    USER ||--o{ COMMENT : creates
    WORKBOOK {
        string id PK
        string name
        datetime created_at
        datetime modified_at
        string owner_id FK
    }
    WORKSHEET {
        string id PK
        string workbook_id FK
        string name
        int order
    }
    VERSION {
        string id PK
        string workbook_id FK
        int version_number
        datetime created_at
        blob data
